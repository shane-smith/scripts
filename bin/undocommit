# Removes the most recent commit, but keeps the changes so you can make additional changes.
# I often will use this rather than amending, because I find it more flexible.
# 
# This is ONLY safe to use if you have not pushed yet. DO NOT use this if the most recent commit has already been pushed to the remote server.
# This also only works for standard commits. Do not try to undo a merge.
