# Contributions
All contributions are appreciated, and will be looked at promptly.

## As a contributor...

You will:
* Document anything that a complete stranger might not understand immediately, using comments in the file.
* Provide a use case or example of how to run the script (if possible).
* Also update the main README.md with a brief description (for new scripts / major changes in functionality).

## As a reviewer...

We will:
* Provide constructive comments where appropriate, keeping in mind that you have generously given up your time to contribute.
* If at all possible, and assuming it fits within the goals of the project, aim to merge in the change as soon as it is ready.

# Attribution

Once your work has been merged in, in addition to being listed by GitHub as a contributor, you will also have your name - and a link to your profile - added to a file in the repository itself.
